# MintPraMim

## POAP-Powered Web3 Social Matching Platform

MintPraMim is an innovative social matching platform that connects people based on their shared interests and experiences as represented by their POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) collections. By leveraging the power of Web3 technology and the Arbitrum Stylus framework, MintPraMim creates meaningful connections between users who have attended similar events or share common digital experiences.

## 🚀 Vision

In a world where digital identities increasingly reflect our real-world interests, MintPraMim acts as a bridge between on-chain activity and social connection. We believe that the events you attend and the digital experiences you participate in create a unique fingerprint of your interests that can be the foundation for meaningful relationships, both personal and professional.

## 🏗️ Architecture

MintPraMim implements a hybrid architecture that leverages both off-chain and on-chain components for optimal performance, user experience, and security:

### 💻 Off-Chain Components

- **Advanced Matching Algorithm**: Complex calculations to determine compatibility between users based on their POAP collections, implemented with efficient computational methods
- **Profile Management**: Secure storage of user profiles, preferences, and matching history
- **User Interface**: Intuitive and engaging frontend experience built with NextJS
- **Initial User Experience**: Streamlined onboarding process and immediate value delivery before requiring blockchain interaction

### ⛓️ On-Chain Components (Arbitrum Stylus)

- **POAP Verification**: Secure on-chain verification of POAP ownership claims
- **Economic Incentives**: Smart contracts written in Rust to manage platform incentives, rewards, and potential tokenized features
- **Premium Features**: Enhanced matching capabilities and additional features for holders of specific POAPs or platform tokens

## 💡 Why Arbitrum Stylus?

Arbitrum Stylus allows us to write smart contracts in Rust, providing:

- Significantly reduced gas costs for computationally intensive operations
- Higher performance for our verification and incentive mechanisms
- Robust and safe programming environment with Rust's strong type system and memory safety
- Full interoperability with existing Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystems

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: NextJS, React
- **Smart Contracts**: Rust with Arbitrum Stylus
- **Development Environment**: PNPM, Git
- **Deployment**: Arbitrum network (mainnet/testnet)

## 🚧 Project Status

MintPraMim is currently in development as part of the Carnival Modular Hackathon (February 26-28, 2025). Stay tuned for updates!

## 👥 Getting Involved
